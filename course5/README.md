# UMGC-242 - Course 5 - Advanced User Interfaces & Listeners

## Section 5a: Over the hill -- Course Half Way Point!
So far we've learned lots of topics the critical ones are:
- Creating classes to model "objects/entities" in our project design.
- Making those classes interact to create more complex behaviors. 
- Creation of exceptions and enums. 

## Section 5b: Project Review

- However lets review the project solution.

## Section 5c: Advanced Hotel Management System

Scenario:
For the rest of the class we are going to put ourselves in the shoes of the team who's been tasked to create/enhance a hotel management system. 

The customer needs: 
- A system that tracks hotel the number of hotel rooms we have available in our two properties.
- We want a user interface that can allow managers and hotel staff to view the rooms we have available and process check ins. 

(this part isn't much diff from what we did last time so we should be able do this quickly)

The customer thinks this is great! And has decided to pay us for additional enhancements. New customer needs:
- When checking folks in we need to be able to specify the guest name and a room number. 
- In addition to showing the number of rooms available we also need to be able to visually SEE what rooms are available/non-available.
- We should be able to click on an occupied room to see the guest information and room number. 
- (Optional) Lastly, we want to give your front desk staff the ability to list all hotel guests or search for a hotel guests room number.

Lets try and tackle each of these.
